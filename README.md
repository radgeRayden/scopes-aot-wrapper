# scopes-aot-wrapper

Module that monkeypatches the Scopes global namespace to replace functions that prevent successful ahead-of-time compilation, then 
builds your application in this environment, outputting an object file. An auxiliary C file is included to replace Scopes' hash functions and allowing complete
independence from libscopesrt.

## Why?
Although the standard libraries avoid reliance on the Scopes API and usage of the non-serializable `string` type, a couple warts remain, since `assert` is non serializable
and used somewhat liberally, and `Map` / `Set` use the API for its hash function. This module provides a replacement for `assert` and a C file is provided that implements
the same hash functions depending directly on xxHash and using the same symbols, in order to link correctly.

## Usage
(more details pending)
- Ensure `aot-wrapper.sc` is in your module search path
- Ensure a `build` directory exists inside the current working directory
- Pass the module returning your `main` function in import syntax as the last command line argument.

`scopes -e -m aot-wrapper .main`

## Additional Tips
To ensure your application will successfully compile to an object file, some caution must be taken. Keeping this in mind from the beginning of the project will make the process
pain free. I will refer multiple times to "runtime code". This means code that doesn't get executed as part of spices and sugars, ie. code that will actually end up in your
executable.
- Avoid usage of compiler API specific types like `string`, `Value` or `Scope` (among others) in runtime code.
- Don't use the `error` family of functions. Raising your own error objects is fine.
- Don't use `print`. Besides depending on `libscopesrt` (which you can optionally link to), it makes use of a `Value` and can't be serialized.
